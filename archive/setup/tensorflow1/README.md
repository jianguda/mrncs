Since there are confliction between cudnn version/Ubuntu version/tensorflow verison
we may change cudnn version. The link can be find here [cudnn version](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/machine-learning/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/), [cuda version](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/).

In this version, we use cuda9.0 and cudnn 7.4
