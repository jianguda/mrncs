## DONE

In this week (Week#11),

- For experiments: have completed the integration of alon-encoder. have tested the alon-model on extracted paths (it can run).
- For thesis draft: have added some contents to "methods" and "discussion" chapter. have made some changes to "introduction" and "background" chapter based on Zimin's comments.

## NEXT-STEPS

1. improve the TS-based path-extractor
2. run experiments on the alon-encoder (when the extractor is ready)
3. improve the implementation if results are not as good as baselines
4. add more contents to the "methods" chapter and "results" chapter
5. improve the thesis draft based on Zimin's latest comments

## QUESTIONS

None.

## Special Note

On the Python corpus, the number of failing ratio is 377651/412178. In contrast, the number of failing ratio is 45724/412178 when using py150k parser and extractor. The next step is to improve the tree-sitter based path-extractor.
