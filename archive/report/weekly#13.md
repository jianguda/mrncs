## DONE

In this week (Week#13),

- For experiments: have implemented 3 trees (AST, HPT, SPT) and 3 paths (leaf2leaf, dfsUD, leaf2leafUD). have tested on all 6 languages. have avoided the memory error (by following the code2vec way). have run alon-model on new-generated tree-paths but failed (I find one small bug).
- For thesis draft: no progress.

## NEXT-STEPS

1. fix bug(s) in implementation and rerun experiments on the alon-model
2. improve the model implementation if results are not as good as baselines
3. add more contents to the "methods" chapter and "results" chapter

## QUESTIONS

None.

## Special Note

I discard CAPT because it mainly replaces concrete identifiers, such as FuncName and VariableName, with abstract labels, like "#FUNC", "#VAR". It removes semantic info hidden in these namings. Meanwhile, it confuses different FuncNames and VariableNames.
I have to spend some time for my PhD applications / interviews so my work progress is not so fast. I will devote more time on my thesis work, or consider to extend my schedule (wish not).
