## DONE
In this week (Week#10),
- For experiments: have improved the scripts. almost have integrated code2seq.
- For thesis draft: have added few content.

## NEXT-STEPS
1) continue the integration of code2seq
2) run experiments on alon-encoder
3) improve the tree-sitter parser

## QUESTIONS
None.

## Special Note
I name the new encoder and model as `alon-encoder` and `alon-model`, because I have made some changes to code2seq, and the current model is very close to code2vec. However, both code2seq and code2vec are authored by Alon, etc. The integration of code2seq is almost done, check [my changes](https://github.com/jianguda/csn#my-changes).
