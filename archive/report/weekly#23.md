## Special Note

Based on Zimin's comments and feedbacks, I improved the writing and now it is ready for thesis defense. Besides, I have found my opponent. I am ready for the defense.

I have reflections on my thesis work. Compared with others, I guess most people do thesis work in one top-down way, but mine is down-top. I feel it is mainly because I want to have good results in the challenge. Moreover, I feel I did not do it very well in determining the direction of my thesis work. At the very beginning, I thought GNN or Attention feels very promising, the main motivation is to follow these most attractive work but I did not survey on how they could bring improvements. Then I feel it seems promising to combine syntactic info with semantic info by introducing tree-path expression from code2seq/code2vec. Even though syntactic info could bring results in some cases, but for the challenge, it is more likely to play negative efforts. And finally, I realize that I should take more care of these prior work on matching tasks, like text-image matching. I believe that would the most right direction. Overall, my first idea was for improving the encoder model, then I wanted to seek for better representations of code data, and finally I realized that I should turn to better model architecture for the matching task. I have done some work for all three ideas, even though, the thesis report is mainly about the second idea.

By the way, is it possible to have further study on the third direction? The main approach is to apply some latest work of matching function learning for semantic code search. Even though these methods do not necessarily generate embedding for code data and query data, which means they are not following the pseudo-siamese matching architecture and not likely to generate embeddings for code data and query data. There is one brief introduction for that topic in the thesis report as well (section 8.2.4). If it is okay, then after I complete the final version of my thesis report in July, I would spend one or two weeks to validate their effectiveness. If they perform better, such as be the new best submissions in the CodeSearchNet challenge, then it is meaningful to spend more time on that!
